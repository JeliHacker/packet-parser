One of this artist's works, painted aeer the end of an affair with his aunt, hangs in the Salle Mollien (sahl mohl-YAN) of the Louvre across from Eugene Delacroix's The Massacre at Chios. This artist may have met a patron in the Beaujon Hospital, from which had been taking dissected limbs. His &#9116;rst biographer, Charles Cle&#769;ment, wrote that the psychiatrist E&#769;tienne-Jean Georget (zhor-ZHAY) commissioned a series of paintings by this artist that includes Portrait of a Kleptomaniac.

        "formatted_text": "A test used to interpret this amendment was described by Antonin Scalia as a \"a ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits up in its grave.\" Laws accused of violating this amendment must not fail the \"purpose,\" \"effect,\" or \"excessive entanglement\" prong under a three-part test established in 1971. In Zorach v. Clauson, the Supreme Court held that school release time programs do not violate this amendment. Many opinions discussing this amendment cite Thomas Jefferson's letter to the Danbury Baptists, which analogizes one of its provisions to a \"wall of separation.\" The Lemon test concerns the interpretation of, for 10 points, what constitutional amendment whose \"establishment\" and \"free exercise\" clauses protect freedom of religion?",

        "formatted_text": "This property and persistence are possessed by the data structures in Clojure (\"closure\"). The opposite of this property in Haskell can be implemented with the State monad, ST monad, and IÂ·OÂ·Ref. Using an object with this property means that no defensive copies are needed. A class that has only accessor methods has this property and, thus, requires that a constructor be called to create a new object. Examples of classes with this property include Java's primitive wrapper classes and String class, as well as Python's tuples (TUH-pulls). Objects with this property are useful because they are intrinsically thread-safe and, in C and C++ (\"c plus plus\"), can be declared using the keyword \"const.\" For 10 points, what property is possessed by objects that cannot have their states changed a er they are created, in contrast to mutable objects?",

Rudolf Peierls (\"PIE-earls\") demonstrated that momentum isn't conserved in a scattering process that involves three of these particles and is balanced by a nonzero k-space vector. Their interactions with electrons lead to the formation of Cooper pairs in BCS theory. On a plot of frequency versus wavevector, the dispersion curves that touch the origin correspond to \"acoustic\" particles of this type. Imposing a cutoff frequency for these particles leads to a temperature-cubed dependence for heat capacity at low temperatures in the Debye (deh-\"BYE\") model. For 10 points, what quasi-particles are the quanta of energy for lattice vibrations?",

This piece unusually features two harps, which first play in its second movement, originally titled \"Memories.\" The coda of this piece's allegro non troppo final movement quotes the opening theme of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony. A section of this piece contains a pastiche combining a theme from the composer's earlier Nikolai Leskov–inspired opera with the song \"You'll Find Me at Maxim's\" from Franz Lehhár's The Merry Widow; that section of this piece is a 22-bar march that repeats twelve times, with each instance adding more instruments and volume.

A buried heterostructure implements a stripe geometry surrounded by a lower refractive index to form an index-guided example of this device. Stabilizing the temperature of these devices is important in order to avoid sudden jumps in their mode spectrum. A seminal paper about examples of these devices with multiple quantum wells was published by Nakamura et al., who used indium gallium nitride as a substrate. The VCSEL (VIK-sel) type of these devices is made with a distributed Bragg re&#6520;ector to cap the cavity. The output of these devices, which is manipulated to make it collimated, depends on the bandgap of the optical gain medium. For 10 points, name these semiconductor devices that create beams of light via stimulated emission.",

Thomas Struth (toh-MAS STROOT) and Andreas Gursky are from this country, whose bombed-out capital appears in a photo of soldiers raising the Soviet &ag above its national legislative building. Bernd and Hilla Becher were from, for 10 points, what country home to the Du&#776;sseldorf School and the Reichstag?",

A man killed at this battle had insisted on fighting as an enlisted man, vowed to \"die up to [his] knees in blood,\" and had his corpse identified when a dentist recognized his fake teeth. A geriatric militiaman who rode to this battle through gunfire is celebrated in a Katherine Shepherd-Smith poem called \"Seth Pomeroy's Ride.\" This battle was initiated after one side tried to fortify the Dorchester Heights. Dr. Joseph Warren was killed at this battle by soldiers commanded by Thomas Gage. During this battle, Israel Putnam is said to have ordered his troops not to fire until you see the whites of their eyes.\" For 10 points, what 1775 battle was, despite its name, actually fought on Breed's Hill?",
