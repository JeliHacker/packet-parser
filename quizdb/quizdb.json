Mutations in a transcription factor ubiquitously expressed in epithelial cells of this organ's medulla result in a disease that manifests as a poly-endo-crinopathy along with muco-cutaneous candi-diasis and Addison's disease. A functional second cervical version of this organ has been identified in mice. Hassall's corpuscles are found in this organ. It is absent in a disease caused by a deletion along the long arm of chromosome 22, called DiGeorge syndrome. Upregulation of the FOXN1 gene allows regeneration of this organ, and deletion of the same gene causes absence of this organ in nude mice. Tumors in this organ are commonly found in patients with myasthenia gravis. Double positive cells in this organ mature to express either CD4 or CD8. This site of positive and negative selection involutes during puberty. For 10 points, name this site of T-cell maturation.",

The Hebrew phrase \"nishmat chayim\" describes the first instance of God performing this action that, in John 20:22, Christ performs on the apostles before saying \"receive ye the Holy Ghost.\" For 10 points, name this action that causes the first man to come alive after God does it into Adam's nostrils.

        "formatted_text": "A movement named for this event was sparked by a 1961 book, in which the argument that it arose from the absence of transcendence in the modern world was put forth by Gabriel Vahanian. Charles Taylor claimed that belief in this event is one of the dominant modern \"closed world structures,\" which arises from both contemporary moral experience and scientific advancement, and that belief in it arises from the belief that the \"immanent frame\" is all-containing. G.W.F. Hegel claimed that this event signified a \"reversal\" and \"the negation of negation.\" Despite this event, shadows will continue to be exhibited in caves \"for millenniums yet\"; in another text, which wonders what \"festivals of atonement\" or \"sacred games\" must be invented in the wake of this event, a madman alleges that all of humanity was responsible for it. For 10 points, name this event postulated by Friedrich Nietzsche in The Gay Science and Also Sprach Zarathustra.",

Three equivalents of aldehyde in ammonia undergo an imine formation, an aldol condensation, and a Michael addition to produce this compound in the Chichibabin synthesis. Derivatives of this compound are found in the Collins reagent, and in one developed by Corey and Suggs from the reaction of this compound with hydrochloric acid and chromium trioxide, known as PCC. Friedel-Crafts reactions fail for this compound since electrophiles react at this compound's basic nitrogen. For 10 points, name this heterocycle consisting of a nitrogen-substituted benzene ring.",

This protein is the non- radioactive compound administered in the Schilling test. This protein binds to a molecule that is released from salivary haptocorrin by trypsin degradation, and it is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach. For 10 points, name this protein that helps in the absorption of cyanocobalamin, aka vitamin B12, and whose deficiency is a cause of pernicious anemia.",

The anti-tubercular agent ethionamide is converted into its active form by an enzyme that catalyzes this reaction. Doerring and Dorfman's early experiments ruled out the dioxirane intermediate hypothesized by the namesakes of this reaction. In its first step, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, followed by a nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon by the oxidizing agent. In the resulting tetrahedral intermediate, the more highly substituted carbon migrates toward the oxygen atom, leading to a carboxylic acid product in a mechanism that was described by Rudolf Criegee. A variant of this reaction in which aryl aldehydes are oxidized is named for Dakin.

        "formatted_text": "Members of the Aspergillus genus catalyze this reaction on de-methyl-sterigmato-cystin to produce aflatoxin. The anti-tubercular agent ethionamide is converted into its active form by an enzyme that catalyzes this reaction. Doerring and Dorfman's early experiments ruled out the dioxirane intermediate hypothesized by the namesakes of this reaction. In its first step, the carbonyl oxygen is protonated, followed by a nucleophilic attack of the carbonyl carbon by the oxidizing agent. In the resulting tetrahedral intermediate, the more highly substituted carbon migrates toward the oxygen atom, leading to a carboxylic acid product in a mechanism that was described by Rudolf Criegee. A variant of this reaction in which aryl aldehydes are oxidized is named for Dakin. For 10 points, name this reaction in which a peroxy-acid, like mCPBA, is used to convert a ketone into an ester, an oxidation reaction named for two chemists, one Swiss and one German. ",

Bounding volumes combined with a Ã¢Â€ÂœmarchingÃ¢Â€Â algorithm named for these constructs is used to implement proximity queries in some collision-detection algorithms. These constructs may be used to approximate a surfaceÃ¢Â€Â™s medial axis, of which they can be considered a discrete analogue. Duals to these constructs can be generated by the trivial Ã¢Â€Âœedge flipÃ¢Â€Â algorithm. One of these constructs can be created by successive recomputation of centroids as part of LloydÃ¢Â€Â™s algorithm. Non-convex polygons comprise one of these constructs when Manhattan distance is used as the norm, but in Euclidean space, these geometric constructs are constructed entirely of convex shapes and are the duals to Delaunay triangulations. For 10 points, name these eponymous diagrams that, given a set of seed points in a space, construct a tessellation by identifying the closest seed point for each point in the space. ",

For 10 points, name this unpublished J.D. Salinger story titled for menacing-looking water.",

A friend of this opera's title character warns her of danger in the aria \"Luogo sicuro questo non Ã¨ piÃ¹!\" after the title character rescues her lover from a ravine. That friend begins this opera by foreshadowing the title character's fate in \"Un di, verso il Murzoll,\" also known as the Edelweiss song. A story by Wilhelmine von Hillern inspired this opera, whose Act I ends with the title character rejecting a forced engagement to Gellner by singing that she would rather go far away and live amid clouds of gold and white snow. This opera closes with Giuseppe Hagenbach calling out to the title character, triggering an avalanche that she jumps into after watching Giuseppe die. For 10 points, the aria \"Ebben? Ne Andro Lontana\" is sung by the title Tyrolean woman of what opera by Alfredo Catalani? ",

One of his paintings shows a deceased child in a white bonnet as her mother wipes her tears away with a handkerchief. This artist of Rachel Weeping painted a work that shows a dead wild turkey in its bottom left corner, as a figure lifts a red curtain to reveal many stuffed birds on display. This man, who exchanged a saddle for art lessons from John Hesselius, showed the central figure of one of his portraits leaning against a cannon and standing over a grounded flag captured from mercenaries in George Washington at Princeton. Alexander Wilson and this artist's sons Linnaeus, Franklin, and Titian are present in a painting by this man that shows a pulley system going into a pit at Barber farm. This painter of The Artist in His Museum also had sons named Raphaelle and Rembrandt. For 10 points, name this early American painter of The Exhumation of the Mastodon.",

This work uses its lone trumpet only in its first, penultimate, and final movements. The opening of this work has the whole orchestra play the following figure twice, in quick unison eighth notes: a D, a D an octave higher, and then two of the lower Ds; that music is brought back in this work's penultimate movement, \"Quoniam tu solus sanctus.\" This work bears many similarities to its composer's earlier work in the same key and genre, RV 588, which uses the same fugue subjects in its \"Cum sancto spiritu\" final movement.

        "formatted_text": "Yang et al. proposed a link between a macroscopic form of this quantity and compressibility with intuitions from the microscopic form of this quantity. It is proportional to the second derivative of energy with respect to the number of electrons in the atom when the molecular geometry is constant. It is approximated as \"one-half the difference between ionization energy and the electron affinity,\" or \"half the gap between the HOMO and the LUMO,\" assuming Koopmans' theorem holds. In the Qual Scheme, metal ions with high values for this quantity form a cluster called the lithophiles, since they demonstrate a propensity to form carbonate, sulfate, and oxide minerals. This quantity describes the ability of the atom to redistribute charge within itself, and is thus a measure for the polarizability of the atom. The idea that systems tend to reorganize themselves to maximize this quantity was postulated by Ralph Pearson. For 10 points, name this quantity from an acid/base theory that is the counterpart of \"softness.\"",

        "formatted_text": "One character in this opera sings \"According to the law? What does that word mean?,\" which was among the reasons that official censors banned this opera during its composer's lifetime. A trumpet call that juxtaposes the triads of D flat and E major represents the title being of this opera. In its epilogue, one character reassures the audience that the opera's events were merely an illusion. Ivan Bilibin designed sets for the premiere of this opera, whose musical highlight is the second act \"Hymn to the Sun.\" This opera, in part a satire on the disastrous conduct of the recent Russo-Japanese war, and indirectly based on Washington Irving's Tales of the Alhambra, includes a difficult tenor altino role for the eunuch Astrologer, who verbalizes his desire for the Queen of Shemakha. In this opera, King Dodon decides to attack Shemakha after hearing the prophetic crowing of the title creature. For 10 points, name this Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov opera based on a Pushkin fairy tale about a magic bird.",

He included a \"Pra&#776;ludium\" marked \"Rasch\" in his sort-of-neo- baroque Piano Suite. Another piece by this composer includes a \"Valse de Chopin\" and uses an \"E-G-E- flat\" motive in a movement subtitled \"Passacaglia.\" He originally used titles like \"The Obbligato Recitative\" and \"Chord Colours\" for his Five Orchestral Pieces, in which he made the first major use of Klangfarbenmelodie. Another piece by this composer uses a different combination of piano, flute, clarinet, violin, and cello in each movement and is a setting \"three times seven poems\" by Albert Giraud using sprechstimme. For 10 points, name this Second Viennese School composer who innovated atonality with pieces like his Three Piano Pieces, Opus 11, and Pierrot Lunaire.",

The Battle of Ulundi was fought by Lord Chelmsford to secure a decisive victory before this man arrived to replace Chelmsford after the loss at Isandlwana.

A third of this man's works, which represents the English with the color green, contains dark green bands representing English immigration to Canada, the U.S., and Australia. This man depicted the progress onward from \"Kowno\" as a dwindling tan bar, and movement back toward Kowno as an increasingly large black bar, in an image that also uses a line plot to show the average temperature. That image by this man, which Edward Tufte called \"the best statistical graphic ever made,\" shows the geographical coordinates, the direction, and the army size during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.

        "formatted_text": "A Dan Berman article on FiveThirtyEight analyzing this country's 1953 election noted how a party that was outspent four-to-one and lost the popular vote by nearly eight points won a parliamentary majority because of laws allowing electoral district sizes to differ by up to 15% from the average. \"Bitter enders\" in this country fomented the Five Shillings Revolt at the start of World War I. This country, which received the largest League of Nations Type C mandate, was once convulsed by a constitutional crisis when the ruling party attempted to amend a \"qualified franchise\" law in a province that covered two- thirds of its area. This country was dominated by the United Party until it was defeated in 1948 by the National Party, which was led by Daniel Francois Malan and ruled through this country's transition from royal dominion to republic in 1961. For 10 points, name this British dominion whose parliament Harold Macmillan addressed in his Winds of Change speech.",

One of this man's paintings consists of a bunch of grapes, a pinecone, and a sickle with a red ribbon on its handle, all below the word \"Dove.\" In an oil painting, this artist used diagonal, fragmented planes to suggest an inspirational, spiritual dimension of a structure owned by the John W. E. Shelman Feed Company in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, thereby linking it with the pyramids. This artist painted nine \"poster portraits\" of his friends, one of which shows shafts of light streaming from two streetlights in the midground and a sign reading \"Carlo.\" In that painting, he used gold leaf for the medium-sized copy of the title symbol, which appears at one end of a fire truck. For 10 points, name this Precisionist artist of I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold.",
